# MultiTool
## Make sure that you use this program as a root user
-----> sudo su
## Weather:
For the weather commands, you will need to make your own tokens, please don't use mine. 
In order to not have these problems I might release another version where you will need to manually fill in every token. 
This is still in alpha version so if you see any bugs or errors please let me know. I will also separate the commands to different files for easier use. After I am done that then there will be a exe package which you can run on windows. I might make a GUI.

## General:
In order to properly install this project, make sure you have python 3 installed on your computer first.
