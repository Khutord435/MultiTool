Make sure that you use this program as a root user

For the weather commands, you will need to make your own tokens, please don't use mine. 
In order to not have these problems I might release another version where you will need to manually fill in every token. 
This is still in alpha version so if you see any bugs or errors please let me know. 


In order to properly install this project, make sure you have python 3 installed on your computer first.
Makes sure that you also have pip and pip3 installed.


Paste these into your terminal or command  line:    sudo su
