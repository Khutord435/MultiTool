# MultiTool
Make sure that you use this program as a root user
-----> sudo su
For the weather commands, you will need to make your own tokens, please don't use mine
In order to not have these problems I might release another version where you will need to manually fill in every token
This is still in alpha version so if you see any bugs or errors please let me know
Before use, make sure to install all of the modules needed in pip3



ENJOY!!!!
